# Master-Thesis_Hari-Vidharth_S4031180

This project was done by Hari Vidharth as a part of Master Thesis in the University of Groningen.

The project supervisors are Prof. Dr Lambert Schomaker (Department of Artificial Intelligence) and Dr Hamidreza Kasaei (Department of Artificial Intelligence).

The main aim of this project is to accelerate the training of an RL agent using demonstrations for OpenAI gym fetch robotics environment suite.

The implementation for all the environments is contained within the RL_BC folder.

The two sources of demonstrations can be found in the oracle folder for the agent demos and the script file for the handrafted demos.

To run and test the environment, use the latest version of anaconda python 3.

Creat a conda virtual environment.

Use the provided requirements.txt file to install all the required packages.

The trained models have been provided for testing and vizualization purposes.

cd into the respective environment folder and use the check.py python file to see the agent in action.

For breif overview and vizualizations of implementation and resutls please check the provided presentation file.

For a more detailed read on the background and theory please look at the provided report.
